Documentation of the code:
1. Utilized feedparser library to extract data and parse the website and store it in parse_rss_feed which will be executed in the main function
2. Implemented SqlAlchemy to interact and local server using PostgreSQL to store the data (make sure when you execute the file you set up DATABASE_URL in database.py
3. Celery for task queuing and management - Set up a very simple code for task management using Celery for queuing and updating the tasks in celeryconfig.py and tasks.py
4. Implemented two algorithms SpaCy and TextBlob for classification:
 - used SpaCy for categorization of the RSS feed
 - used TextBlob for Sentimental analysis which returns a +1 or -1 value on basis of sentiment (additional thing i have added)
5. I could not setup logging into the files however I have coded the utils.py but i could not get enough time to implement it in each of the files.

That is all I hope you like my work.
Wishing the best response and looking forward with all enthusiasm to be working with 10Times!!
